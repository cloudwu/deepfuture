# Deep Future

[简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

> Settle worlds, advance techs, and endlessly evolve your galaxy's deep future. 

This is a digital version of the board game [Deep Future](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194986/deep-future) originally designed by [R. Winder](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/89526/r-winder). Both English and Simplified Chinese are supported. It can be played on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Deep Future is a “**Make-as-You-Play**” game, which means that the game starts with a few materials (a map, paper, index cards, and colored cubes) and the remaining components will be generated as needed during play. Each game will see the addition of new cards, which represent the worlds in the galaxy, the techs invented, and the lasting impact of previous civilizations.

The [rules](./rules/Deep_Future_Rules_1_6.pdf) include tables and guidelines for creating new cards as needed, and this makes every copy of Deep Future an evolving galaxy. In addition, it means that each game inherits all components added or changed in the previous games. The galaxy’s content — its worlds, techs, and history — can grow endlessly over a connected campaign as players return to see what each new era holds for the future of humanity.
